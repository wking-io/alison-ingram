            <p>I grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, surrounded by love, laughter, and Auburn football. My mother is an educator, having spent nearly 28 years first as a special education teacher and now as a school psychologist. She never pushed education upon me as a career, allowing me to fall in love with it on my own. And I have.  </p>
            <p>After graduating from Saint James School, I embarked on my collegiate journey. I always knew the Loveliest Village on the Plains was for me. I entered college with the passion to be an elementary school teacher, and that passion has grown. </p>
            <p>I was admitted to Auburn University’s Elementary Education program in 2014. The two-year program both challenged and inspired me to become a better teacher. My high marks earned membership in Phi Kappa Phi collegiate honor society. I am on track to graduate Summa Cum Laude in May 2016.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="wrapper__two-column--column-two">
            <p>It is my dream to inspire and excite children to become life long learners and to help them reach their full potential. The adorable Kid President once said, “You were made to be awesome.” My aim is to convey that sentiment to each and every student I have the opportunity to teach. </p>
            <p>I am a firm believer that coffee starts every day off right. School supplies excite me more than they should any human being. Despite being tethered to electronics like most my age, I still get a joy from writing things down in my old-school planner. As for my personal interests, this is where the one-half of my father kicks in: I am an Auburn football fanatic. Thanks to my dad, I love most all sports. </p>
            <p>As for my other hobbies, I love antiques, flea markets, and “fixer-upper” shows on television. More than anything, I treasure my relationship with God. For further information about me, explore this webpage or please feel free to contact me.</p>

            <p>I believe in the individuality of children, and that each child has the potential to bring something new and special to this world. As a teacher I will help children learn to believe that they are capable individuals. In doing so, potential will develop in them. In the process, I will strive to help students develop their own ideas and express their opinions. As a teacher, I believe my role is to guide the students as they search for knowledge and to find answers to life’s questions. For them to be able to gain knowledge, they must be given opportunities to discover. By providing opportunities for children to discover new things, I hope to establish the importance of intellectual curiosity and the desire to be lifelong learners. </p>

            <p>One of the most beneficial aspects of being a teacher is to see the progress students are making in their learning. Assessments are a key tool when it comes to observing students’ progress. The assessments in my classroom will be both formal and informal. It is my job to make sure students can apply their knowledge in both traditional and alternative assessments. As a teacher, it is important to realize that assessment is not just a student role, but one for the teacher as well. Assessing my teaching will allow me to better achieve my goal of making my students lifelong learners.  </p>

            <p>Since every child is unique, each learning strategy will be special in its own right. As a teacher, I will do my best to reach every learning strategy through group work, interactive lectures, and hands-on activities. Because children have different learning styles, I will have to accommodate these styles so that they are useful for learning. Many students will take up habits from me, so I must show interest in the lesson myself, and be enthusiastic about learning. I must convince the students that they are knowledgeable before they will want to learn. I will try to point out each of their abilities,  give them a sense of pride in who they are, and focus on the idea that the classroom is a place where the students can share ideas and learn from each other. Students should value their differences and feel comfortable sharing  them with others without fear of criticism. </p>

            <p class="no-indent">Keeping diligent student records will assist me in my self-reflection process. It is essential to seek professional development throughout my career and continue my lifelong learning goal.

            <p>It has been said that developing intelligence and building character are the true goals of education. As a teacher, it is important for me to equip my students with the ability to apply information in the real world; I can never forget that education does not simply stop at facts. Education helps children establish their character. I hope I never forget the immense responsibility it is to shape the future in both intelligence and, most importantly, character.</p>
